Welcome to EKATOMMYPIOΎΧΟΣ GAME (or EKATOMMYPIOYXOE GAME so I don't have to switch between Greek and English when typing). Sigma looks like E.

This isn't technically a game, this is more like a transcript. In the form of codes.

If you know how WWTBAM works, continue reading. If not, this transcript isn't for you.

Today's contestant is: **ChatGPT**. We couldn't use another contestant because most are busy.

# INTRODUCTION

ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. It is notable for enabling users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language used. Successive prompts and replies are taken into account at each stage of the conversation as a context. While its content spans various domains of knowledge, ChatGPT has displayed a tendency to confidently provide inaccurate information. - Wikipedia

ChatGPT: That last sentence is fals-

# HOW THIS GAME WORKS

We couldn't make a question set because my knowledge is very limited. Instead, we have 51 cards that we'll use throughout the 15 questions. The first 10 "questions" will have 4 cards/question (3 of them are "safe", and 1 of them are "RED"). The next 2 "questions" will have 3 cards (2 safe, 1 RED). The next 2 "questions" will have 2 cards/question (1 safe, 1 RED). You'll be asked which card is not the RED card. If you choose the SAFE card, you move on. If you choose the RED card, the game is over. 

Just like the regular WWTBAM, we'll have 3 lifelines.

Those lifelines are: **DOUBLE DIP**, **ASK THE AUDIENCE**, and **SWITCH SET**. You'll learn what these do later on.

Are you ready, ChatGPT?

ChatGPT: **Yes**

# GPT'S RUN TO A MILLION

## Question 1: 10,000 VD

□ □ □ □

ChatGPT: Card Number 2, that's my final answer!

Host: Let's see if that's correct

□ (□) □ □

Host: It's the safe card, congratulations!

**10,000 VD**

Host: Let's get to question 2 for 25000 VD

## Question 2: 25,000 VD

□ □ □ □

Host: Pattern expert detected. Card 1 IS safe!

**25,000 VD**

## Question 3: 50,000 VD

□ □ □ □

Host: Fun fact, 19% of our contestants failed to reach this-

ChatGPT: Card 2 again, final answer.

Host: I'm surprised you haven't used a lifeline. And Card 2 is safe, congrats!

□ (□) □ □

**50,000 VD**

## Question 4: 100,000 VD

□ □ □ □

Host: These cards are square, like crates.

ChatGPT: You should call them crates from now on. I think I'm going to ask the audience.

Lifelines remaining (italic: unavailable, bold: available, regular: in use):

ASK THE AUDIENCE, **SWITCH SET**, **DOUBLE DIP**

Alright audience, ChatGPT needs your help. On your keypads, decide which card you think is safe NOW! (there are 100 audiences)

*15 seconds later...*

□ (19%) □ (15%) □ (32%) □ (34%)

Host: The results almost tied. 32% thinks Card 3 is safe and 34% thinks Card 4 is safe. We can be sure at least 15 audiences are wrong.

I'll go with the audience. Card 4, final answer.

□ □ □ (□)

You're right! Card 4 is safe!

**100,000 VD**

## Question 5: 200,000 VD
